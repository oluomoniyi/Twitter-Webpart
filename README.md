# Twitter-Webpart
Recently I had to pull Tweets from multiple twitter handles into one Tweet timeline on a SharePoint page to work in legacy versions of Internet Explorer.  Now Twitterâ€™s timeline API does not support legacy versions of IE (for good reason might I add ), so I had to create a tweet timeline, which worked on legacy IE and more up to date browsers.
